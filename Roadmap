1. Ctrc-c

2. Init data:
    => set hint (af_inet etc)
    => echo_header (packet header type, id etc + CHECKSUM)
        => checksum = packt + sizeof packet

3. Parsing options

4. Init socket => socket, setsockopt

5. Resolve addr
    => getaddrinfo (the step where you check if the host exists)

6. Print dest info
    => inet_ntop, printf like ping

7. Infinite loop:
    => send_ping
        => gettimeofday with struc timeval
        => sendto() and recvfrom()
        => ttl and rtt
    => check response
        => ICMP_ECHOREPLY, update rtt (sqr sum shit) and display ping info
        => OR handle network errors (unreacheable, time exceeded etc)
    => update_pkt
        => increment seq and reset + redo checksum
    => sleep (time)

8. Clean exit 
    => closing socket, freeaddrinfo, whatever was allocated
    => display all stats
